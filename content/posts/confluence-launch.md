We’re excited to announce the launch of our data storytelling lab.
Our aim is to investigate, analyse, and visualise complex data problems to help share the stories buried within them.

To validate our stories, we tie our data analysis to field journalism to understand how driving forces—whether climate, policy, census, or otherwise—impact people.

Stay tuned as we embark on this new journey of combining data and storytelling!
